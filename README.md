# Hi, I'm Katie 👋

I’m a Software Engineer who learned to code and never looked back! I specialize in front-end and mobile development, specifically with React / React Native and JavaScript frameworks.

My background in both fitness and executive support has always centered on helping others succeed. In these roles, I relied on a wide range of software tools and became increasingly interested in how those systems were built. This curiosity ultimately pushed me toward pursuing software engineering, where I can create my own solutions to help others.

I graduated from Coding Dojo at Colorado Technical University in July 2025 with 3 full stacks under my belt. Since then, I’ve built many projects including a cross platform mobile application with 2 distinct interfaces and dozens of screens to handle complex task management workflows. Built for a client alongside a backend engineer and a UI/UX designer, this project highlights my work as the front-end engineer. It showcases my technical expertise and my ability to deliver robust, feature-rich solutions through effective collaboration. Check out the project below!
