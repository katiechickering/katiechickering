# Hi, I'm Katie 👋

I’m a software engineer who learned to code and never looked back! I specialize in front-end and mobile development, specifically with React / React Native and JavaScript frameworks.

With a background in both the fitness and executive assistant industries, I have spent my career in roles centered on helping others succeed. These positions exposed me to a wide range of softwares and I realized I wanted to be the one building the systems I was using.

I graduated from Coding Dojo at Colorado Technical University in July 2025 with 3 full stacks under my belt. Since then, I’ve built many projects including a 30-page cross platform mobile application with 2 distinct interfaces to handle complex task management workflows. This project, built in an Agile team of 3 for a client, showcases my expertise in cross-functional collaboration and the technical skills required to deliver robust, feature-rich solutions. Check out the project in the link below!
